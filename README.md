pyDwarf
A tunnel building program for the avid Minecraft Pi dwarf.
Purpose:     Designed to build descending, ascending and straight tunnels in Minecraft Pi.
             This is written very simply for debugging/learning purposes.
             Most of this code is designed to handle user input.
             Eventually this will be integrated into classes etc.

Usage: 
from mcpi import minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
